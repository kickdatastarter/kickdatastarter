		<h2>Conclusion</h2><br/>
		<p>In the end, a database of the Library Facilities Reservation System has been established, a Java Web program is written in order to connect the database with the front-end web page. A sample dataset is established to test the system functionality. The testing results show that all use cases are fulfilled. </p>
		<p>However, at this moment the Library Facilities Reservation System model still has its limitations and flaws, future works are still needed to improve the performance of the system, one of the most recommended future work is to optimizing the code to enhance the efficiency.</p>
