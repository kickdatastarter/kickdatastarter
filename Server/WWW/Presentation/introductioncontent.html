		<h2>Introduction</h2><br/>
		<p>We reserve the facilities in our school library everyday. And our group finds that there can be some inprovement on the reservation systems. So this project is a basic library facilities reservation systems with some add-ons. </p>
		<p>The basic functions include:</p>
		<p>1:Guests can browse and search all available facilities and rooms.</p>
		<p>2:Users can form a group by adding friends and delete a group.</p>
		<p>3:Users can make a reservation on behalf of a group and every member of the group gains same permission.</p>
		<p>4:Users can manage their own reservations on "My Account" page, i.e. canceling or altering.</p>
		<p>5:Administrator can add, remove, manage status of facilities and users.</p>
		
		<p>The inprovement functions include:</p>
		<p>1:The system will cancel this reservation automatically if grace time expires(15 minutes after the reserved time). After that, the facility or the room becomes "first-come, first-serve".</p>
		<p>2:Administrators can manage the availability of facilities and rooms and the status of users. If the availability is maintainting, no one can reserved it.</p>
		<p>3:We simulate the process of gaining access for the facilities by swiping the card, or login their account on computer (for computer only).</p>
